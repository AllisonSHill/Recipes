# Recipes Database

## .Net Core Razor Pages Recipe App

I wanted to create a simple application that would allow the user to store recipes in a database for personal use. I cook a lot, so I create a lot of recipes, and I haven't found to record them in a format that is useful for me to reference later. I wanted to create a simple app that would serve that purpose, as a personal recipe database. This app allows the user to add recipes, with minimal information required, and then add ingredients to that recipe with required information as well. The recipes then display in a simple format without extra info so they can be quickly referenced and remembered.
